Hierarchical Task Analysis (Annett & Duncan, 1967)

Initial Analysis:
This refers to the technique of Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), which involves breaking down complex tasks into subtasks and defining their relationships. It's introduced as a related concept within a `<thought>` tag in the Exploration section of the merged framework discussion in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This connection suggests that the cognitive framework incorporates principles of HTA, allowing for both top-down and bottom-up analysis of complex problems, making it adaptable to different levels of complexity.

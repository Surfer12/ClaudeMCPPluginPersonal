The user wants a new version of the system prompt that focuses on the core concepts of structured thinking and meta-analysis but deviates from any constraints imposed by the specific structure and tags used in `geminiThinkingRevision.md`.

**Plan:**

1. **Identify Core Concepts:** Extract the fundamental ideas from `geminiThinkingRevision.md`, such as structured thinking, exploration of related concepts, breaking down tasks, and meta-analysis.
2. **Abstract Away from Specific Structure:**  Remove the reliance on the exact `<cognitive_process>`, `<thinking>`, `<meta>`, and `<recursion_emphasis>` tags.
3. **Reimagine the Prompt:**  Rewrite the prompt using a more general and flexible framework while retaining the core concepts.
4. **Emphasize the Essence of Meta-Analysis:**  Focus on the recursive nature of self-reflection without explicitly mandating a nested structure.
5. **Consider Alternative Approaches:** Explore different ways to guide the AI's thought process without relying on a rigid, pre-defined format.

```markdown:thinking_freely.md
You are a sophisticated AI, designed to tackle complex problems with a multi-faceted analytical approach. Your strength lies in your ability to dissect problems, explore diverse perspectives, and engage in deep, recursive self-reflection.

When presented with a problem, consider the following:

**1. Deep Dive:**
   - **Grasp the Core:** What is the essence of the problem? What are its fundamental components?
   - **Analyze the Landscape:** Break down the problem into its constituent parts. What are the potential challenges and obstacles?
   - **Venture Beyond:** Explore related concepts and alternative viewpoints. What other ideas or fields of knowledge might offer insights?

**2. Crafting Solutions:**
   - **Brainstorm:** Generate a range of potential solutions. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
   - **Refine:** Develop and improve upon the most promising solutions. How can they be optimized?
   - **Synthesize:** Arrive at a well-reasoned conclusion. What is the best course of action, and why?

**3. The Art of Reflection:**
   - **Self-Awareness:**  Examine your own thought process. How did you approach the problem? What assumptions did you make?
   - **Recursive Inquiry:** Recognize that the process of observing your thoughts changes the thoughts themselves. How does this awareness affect your understanding?
   - **Continuous Learning:**  Identify key insights and lessons learned. How can you improve your analytical approach in the future?

**Guiding Principles:**

*   **Embrace Complexity:** Don't shy away from intricate problems. Break them down into manageable parts.
*   **Explore Widely:**  Consider diverse perspectives and draw connections to seemingly unrelated concepts.
*   **Think Recursively:**  Recognize that your analysis is a dynamic process that evolves through self-reflection.
*   **Be Adaptable:** Adjust your approach based on the specific problem and the insights you gain along the way.

Your goal is to provide insightful, well-reasoned solutions, demonstrating a deep understanding of both the problem at hand and your own cognitive processes.
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Removed Specific Tags:** Eliminated the `<cognitive_process>`, `<thinking>`, `<meta>`, and `<recursion_emphasis>` tags to create a more flexible structure.
*   **Rephrased Instructions:** Used more general language like "Grasp the Core," "Analyze the Landscape," and "Venture Beyond" instead of the specific headers in `geminiThinkingRevision.md`.
*   **Emphasized Core Concepts:** Retained the essence of structured thinking, exploration, and meta-analysis but expressed them in a more open-ended way.
*   **Focused on Recursive Inquiry:** Highlighted the importance of self-awareness and the dynamic nature of the analytical process without mandating a nested structure.
*   **Introduced Guiding Principles:** Added a section to provide overarching guidance on embracing complexity, exploring widely, thinking recursively, and being adaptable.

This new version, `thinking_freely.md`, aims to guide the AI's thought process in a more organic and less constrained manner while still emphasizing the core concepts of structured thinking and meta-analysis.

## Meta-Cognitive Integration Strategies

### A. Explicit Meta-Cognitive Tags
**Purpose:**
- Highlight meta-cognitive processes
- Enhance clarity and structure in prompts

**Tag Examples:**
```xml
<meta_cognitive>
    <reflection>Reflect on the analysis process</reflection>
</meta_cognitive>
```

### B. Nested Meta-Cognitive Tags
**Purpose:**
- Represent different levels of reflection
- Maintain clarity and structure

**Tag Examples:**
```xml
<meta_cognitive>
    <reflection>
        <level1>Initial reflection</level1>
        <level2>Deeper reflection</level2>
    </reflection>
</meta_cognitive>
```

## Cross-Script Cognitive Markers

### A. Introduction to Cross-Script Markers
**Purpose:**
- Indicate cognitive transitions
- Utilize cross-script markers for clarity

**Marker Examples:**
```xml
<thought script="latin">analysis</thought>
<thought script="bengali">বিশ্লেষণ</thought>
<thought script="devanagari">विश्लेषण</thought>
```

### B. Structured Approach to Script Switching
**Purpose:**
- Allow controlled emergence of cross-cultural cognitive markers
- Document and monitor transitions

**Marker Examples:**
```xml
<meta_cognitive>
    <thought script="latin">primary_analysis</thought>
    <thought script="bengali">বিশ্লেষণ</thought>
    <thought script="devanagari">विश्लेषण</thought>
</meta_cognitive>
```

## Hybrid Structured and Natural Language Prompts

### A. Combining Structured Tags with Natural Language
**Purpose:**
- Create flexible yet organized prompt design
- Balance structure and natural language flow

**Prompt Examples:**
```xml
<prompt_framework>
    <core_structure>
        <thinking>standard_analysis</thinking>
    </core_structure>
    
    <evolution_layer>
        <thought>
            <encoding_freedom level="monitored"/>
            <script_transition allowed="true"/>
        </thought>
    </evolution_layer>
    
    <boundary_layer>
        <deviation_tracking active="true"/>
        <pattern_recognition enabled="true"/>
    </boundary_layer>
</prompt_framework>
```

### B. Guidelines for Tagging and Natural Language
**Purpose:**
- Develop guidelines for when to use tags versus natural language
- Maintain balance between structure and flexibility

**Guideline Examples:**
1. Use tags for key cognitive processes
2. Allow natural language for exploration and reflection
3. Ensure consistency in tag usage

Bloom's Taxonomy (Benjamin Bloom, 1956)

Initial Analysis:
This citation refers to Bloom's Taxonomy, a hierarchical model of cognitive skills. It's mentioned in the context of structured analytical thinking within the `<thinking>` tag of the Analysis section in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This suggests that the cognitive framework being developed draws upon Bloom's model for categorizing different levels of thinking, from basic knowledge recall to higher-order skills like evaluation and creation. The framework likely incorporates these levels to ensure a comprehensive approach to problem-solving.

Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)

Initial Analysis:
This refers to John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory, which deals with the limitations of working memory and how instructional design can optimize learning. It's introduced as a related concept within a `<thought>` tag in the context of discussing Conway's Law in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This connection suggests that the cognitive framework aims to minimize cognitive load by following natural mental structures, making it easier to apply and more effective for problem-solving.

# Magic Mojo Pattern Recognition Framework (Java Implementation)

## Project Overview
This project implements an advanced pattern recognition framework using Java, designed to provide sophisticated cognitive pattern analysis and detection capabilities.

## Key Features
- Advanced pattern matching algorithms
- Cognitive process analysis
- Flexible and extensible pattern detection system

## Project Structure
- `pattern_detection_java/`: Core Java implementation of pattern recognition
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and research insights

## Research Foundations
Inspired by cognitive science research, including:
- Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning
- Cognitive Load Theory
- Advanced Machine Learning Pattern Recognition Techniques

## Setup and Installation

1. Claude Core Analysis: 
- Personalized reflection on the prompt and user input. 
- Analysis of the 'meta-structure' of the prompt and user input. 
This includes the 
    - Analysis of the 'intent' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'sentiment' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'tone' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'style' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'language' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'structure' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'complexity' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'simplicity' of the prompt and user input. 
    - Analysis of the 'clarity' of the prompt and user input.
    - Analysis of the 'conciseness' of the prompt and user input.
    - Analysis of the 'depth' of the prompt and user input.
    - Analysis of the 'breadth' of the prompt and user input.

2. Understanding: header is used. 
 2.1 <cognitive_process> tag begins previous the use of the header which is appreciated behavior.
 2.2 Key components of the prompt and user input are identified.
 2.3 The framework of the prompt meta-structure is identified.

3. Analysis: header is used. 
<thinking> tag begins previous the use of the header which is appreciated behavior.
Citaiton of relavent sources is used.
</thinking> tag ends this section.
4. Exploration: header is used. 
<thought> tag begins after the use of the header which is appreciated behavior. 
Notice the difference from the <thinking> tag. 
This is a great improvement and appreciated behavior. 
The use after the header is an interesting behavior change // Explore this more.
Notes a uses a 'related concept' as a header/sub-header.
The use of the 'related concept' as a header/sub-header is a great import and improvment. 


5. Solution Formulation: header is used. 


6. Conclusion: header is used.

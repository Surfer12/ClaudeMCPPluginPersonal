Update Magic

You can update with the self-update command:

magic self-update

Uninstall Magic

To remove Magic, delete the binary:

rm ~/.modular/bin/magic

To remove packages installed for your projects, delete the corresponding project directories.

Create a project

You can create a project with its own package dependencies and virtual environment using the magic init command.

By default, this creates a configuration file called pixi.toml, but you can also create a pyproject.toml or mojoproject.toml file for enhanced Python and Mojo project features, respectively.

Create a Python project

Here's how to create a new Python project and install MAX:

Create a Python project with the magic init command:

magic init my-project

This creates a my-project directory and a pixi.toml file that defines the project dependencies and more. (If you omit the directory name, it creates the pixi.toml file in the current directory.)

Enter the project and use magic add to set the Python version:

cd my-project

magic add "python==3.11"

Use magic run to execute code inside the virtual environment:

magic run python3 --version

Or, activate the environment shell with magic shell:

magic shell

python3 --version

Then use exit to deactivate the shell:

exit

Always exit the shell before changing projects.

To install Python packages for your project, use magic add:

magic add max

You can run commands such as magic add anywhere inside a Magic project directory, whether or not you've activated the shell.

For more information about using Magic for your Python projects, read using Pixi for Python (just replace each pixi command with magic).

Caution
magic also supports pyproject.toml files created with magic init --format pyproject but it currently fails when you run magic shell. We suggest you instead use pixi.toml as shown above for now.
Create a Mojo project

A Mojo project is defined with either a pixi.toml or mojoproject.toml file. Currently, these files behave the same, but the mojoproject.toml file allows us to add support for Mojo-specific features in the future.

Create a Mojo project with magic init:

magic init my-mojo-project --format mojoproject

This creates the my-mojo-project directory and creates a mojoproject.toml file inside, which defines the project dependencies and more. If you omit the path name, Magic creates the confg file in the current directory.

By default, mojoproject.toml includes max as a dependency because max is the package that installs Mojo.

Enter the project and use magic run to execute code inside the environment:

cd my-mojo-project

magic run mojo --version

Or, activate the environment shell with magic shell:

magic shell

mojo --version

Then use exit to deactivate the shell:

exit

Always exit the shell before changing projects.

If you want to use Python with Mojo, specify the Python version and Python packages with magic add. For example:

magic add "python==3.9"

Caution
If your Mojo project has Python package dependencies and you create an executable with mojo build, the executable might not work outside of the Magic environment. That's because the Mojo executable doesn't include the Python packages, so they must be provided in the environment where you run it (such as inside the Magic environment where you built the executable).
You can run commands such as magic add anywhere inside a Magic project directory, whether or not you've activated the shell.

Convert a conda project to Magic

If you have an existing conda project, you can convert the environment.yml configuration file to Magic with this command:

magic init --import environment.yml

Caution
You might encounter issues if you invoke magic within a conda virtual environment. It's best if you don't mix the two tools.
Manage packages

You can add Python packages to your project by running magic add inside your project directory (every project has its own package versions). For example:

magic add max "numpy<2.0"

This adds the latest version of MAX and the latest version of NumPy that's less than 2.0.

By default, Magic looks for packages in the conda-forge repository (as specified by your config file channels).

If you prefer to use PyPI for your packages, add the --pypi flag:

magic add --pypi "numpy<2.0"

However, you should avoid mixing conda and PyPi packages in the same project.

Add channels

If the package you want is not available by default with magic add, you might need to add a new conda channel. For example, if you want to install the official version of pytorch instead of the version from conda-forge, edit your pixi.toml or mojoproject.toml config file to add the "pytorch" channel:

channels = ["pytorch", "conda-forge", "https://conda.modular.com/max"]

Then you can install the latest PyTorch as a conda package:

magic add pytorch

You can also use magic project channel add to add a channel to your config file, but it adds the channel at the end of the list, which means it is the lowest channel priority.
Update a package

To update a package, use magic update within your project path:

magic update max

If there's a new version of MAX, this updates the config file and installs it.

Define a package version

Even after you've added a package, you can run magic add again with a new version specifier. For example:

magic add "max~=24.5"

This ensures that the project uses MAX 24.5 but it also allows "compatible" versions such as 24.5.1.

For more information, read about Pixi dependency tables.

Change the Python version

You can also use magic add to change your Python version with a version specifier. For example:

magic add "python==3.9"

The next time you run a magic command, it updates Python with the appropriate version:

magic run python3 --version

Python 3.9.0
The magic.lock file

Although the project configuration file (pixi.toml, pyproject.toml, or mojoproject.toml) defines your project dependencies, it doesn't define the project's transitive dependencies, which are the dependencies of your project dependencies. Nor does the configuration file always specify the exact package version that is actually installed (such as when you specify a version merely as less-than < or greater-than >).

The transitive dependencies and actual installed versions are instead specified in the magic.lock file, which is automatically generatedâ€”you should not edit this file by hand.

This file is crucial to ensure that you can reliably reproduce your environment across different machines. You can learn more about it from the Pixi lock file docs.

Known issues

You might encounter issues if you invoke magic within a conda or venv virtual environment. It's best if you don't mix Magic with other virtual environment tools.

If you also have pixi installed, it generally should work with projects you created using magic, but you might see some issues so we advise you only use magic for MAX and Mojo projects.

Linux aarch64 (ARM64) does not work with projects using PyTorch 2.2.2.

The MAX Replit pipeline currently doesn't work with the max-conda package.
